	<title>Configuring</title>
	<para>You must fine-tune Memory and Database settings for better performance before using &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; in production. Once you complete setting up the Gateway you must configure the SS7 Stack and GMLC paramters. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; comes with a convenient user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command Line Interface (CLI) that will allow you to configure, monitor and manage the Gateway. While the CLI tool allows complete configuration and control of the Gateway, the GUI-based management enhances the usability of the Gateway and gives you the ability to configure and manage the GMLC Gateway dynamically. This chapter will explain how to manage the Gateway effectively using both the GUI and the CLI.
